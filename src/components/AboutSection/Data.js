  information: "I am a Front-end developer from Novi Sad in Serbia with a university degree in English language and literature. My journey of learning to code started as a curiosity and become a passion and later job. I started with HTML and CSS and later on with Bootstrap library. Once I felt comfortable to code with those technologies, I moved on to JavaScript, which principles and syntax I’m constantly thriving to improve. Lately I’m practicing ReactJs and learning NodeJs and Express.",
